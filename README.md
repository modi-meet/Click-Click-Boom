## Features

This project started as a basic counter and evolved into an engaging, interactive web application.  
It demonstrates how to enhance user experience with dynamic feedback, animations, and **state management**.

- **Dynamic Messages:** Text changes based on your click count, encouraging you along the way.  
- **Progress Bar:** Shows how close you are to your first milestone.  
- **Milestone Celebrations:** At **100 clicks**, an in-component confetti celebration appears.  
- **Super Celebration:** At **115 clicks**, a page-wide animation & confetti storm are unleashed!  
- **Modern UI with CSS:** Clean design, hover effects, and button animations.  
- **State Lifting:** Demonstrates the React concept of "lifting state up" for parent-child communication.
